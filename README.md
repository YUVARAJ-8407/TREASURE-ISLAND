Treasure Island – Python Console Game

Treasure Island is a simple interactive console game built using Python. The player progresses through multiple decision stages by choosing between given options. Only the correct sequence of choices leads to winning the game, while incorrect choices end the game.

The project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, input validation, and control flow using while, break, and continue. It also includes a restart feature that allows the player to replay the game without restarting the program.

This project was created to practice logical thinking, user input handling, and basic game flow design in Python.
